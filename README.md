# HectoClash

A project made during HackFest 2025

**HectoClash** is a real-time, competitive mental math game inspired by the Hectoc format. It brings together high-speed calculation, strategic thinking, and engaging multiplayer gameplay to create an educational yet thrilling experience.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Traditional mental math games often lack real-time competition, interactive elements, and post-game analysis—resulting in lower engagement and limited learning opportunities. There’s a need for a platform that combines education with high-energy competition to make mental math exciting, trackable, and social.

## 💡 About Hectoc

**Hectoc** is a mental math challenge in which players are given a six-digit number (e.g., `123456`) and must insert any combination of mathematical operations (`+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`, `^`) and parentheses to make the expression evaluate to exactly 100.

> ✅ *Example:*  
> Input: `367626`  
> Output: `(36 + 76 - 2 × 6) = 100`

Despite its educational value, there is no competitive platform that enables **real-time duels** using Hectoc-style challenges—until now.

## 🚀 Solution

### 🎯 Game Modes

- **Duels**
  - *First to 5 Solves:*  
    Players compete head-to-head. The first to solve 5 puzzles correctly wins.  
    Supports both drag-and-drop interaction for touchscreen devices and traditional mouse/keyboard input for desktop users.

- **Battle Royale** *(Coming Soon)*  
  A larger-scale mode where many players compete simultaneously. Solve quickly to survive—last one standing wins!

- **Practice Mode**  
  Sharpen your skills at your own pace. No pressure, just you and the puzzles. Great for warmups and solo improvement.

## ⏳ Before the Hackathon

When we came across the problem statement, we were instantly drawn to it. The challenge combined creativity, learning, and real-world technical skills. 

This was our **first time building a multiplayer game**, and the learning curve was steep—but rewarding. We explored:

- **Real-time systems** with WebSockets and Pub/Sub architectures.
- **Scalable infrastructure** using Docker and Kubernetes.
- **Efficient backend development** with Go’s concurrency model.
  
Even before the hackathon began, we had already grown significantly—both technically and creatively. That foundational work shaped the way we designed HectoClash.

## 📚 What is Hectoc?

**Hectoc** is a puzzle where you're given a 6-digit number and must reach 100 using math operations and parentheses—without rearranging the digits.

✅ *Example:*  
Input: `367626`  
Output: `(36 + 76 - 2 × 6) = 100`
